--------------------------------------GAME RULES---------------------------------------------------

Uno (with QuickPlay) is a modified game simulation of the popular Mattel game, Uno.    

--------------------------------------EQUIPMENT----------------------------------------------------
The deck consists of 108 cards, of which there are twenty-five of each color (red, green, blue, and yellow), each color having two of each rank except zero. The ranks in each color are zero to nine, "Skip", "Draw Two", and "Reverse" (the last three being "action cards"). In addition, the deck contains four each of "Wild" and "Wild Draw Four" cards.

--------------------------------------GAME PLAY----------------------------------------------------  
There are two game modes for this version of Uno.

---Gameplay for the Classic Mode
To start a hand, seven cards are dealt to each player, and the top card of the deck is flipped over and set aside to begin the discard pile. The player to the dealer's left plays first, unless the first card on the discard pile is an action or Wild card (see below). On a player's turn, he/she must do one of the following:
play a card matching the discard in color, number, or symbol
play a Wild card, or a playable Wild Draw Four card (see restriction below)
draw the top card of the deck

Play proceeds clockwise around the table.

Action and Wild cards have the following effects:


Card			Effect when played from hand																																					Effect as first discard

Skip			Next player in sequence misses a turn 																																			Player to dealer's left misses a turn 
Draw Two		Next player in sequence draws two cards and misses a turn 																														Player to dealer's left draws two cards and misses a turn 
Reverse			Order of play switches directions (clockwise to counterclockwise, or vice versa) 																								Dealer plays first; play proceeds counterclockwise 
Wild			Player declares next color to be matched (may be used on any turn even if the player has matching color) 																		Player to dealer's left declares starting color, then plays normally 
Wild Draw Four	Player declares next color to be matched; next player in sequence draws four cards and misses a turn. Is legally played only if the player has no cards of the current color 	Return card to deck, shuffle, flip top card to start discard pile 

If a player draws a card that is playable, the player has the option of either keeping it or playing it immediately. Having drawn from the deck, the player will not use any other card from his/her hand on that turn.
A player may play a Wild card at any time, even if that player has other playable cards.
A player may play a Wild Draw Four card only if that player has no cards matching the current color. The player may have cards of a different color matching the current number or symbol or a Wild card and still play the Wild Draw Four card.[3] A player who plays a Wild Draw Four may be challenged by the next player in sequence (see Penalties) to prove that his or her hand meets this condition.
If the entire deck is used during play, the top discard is set aside and the rest of the pile is shuffled to create a new deck. Play then proceeds normally.
It is illegal to trade cards of any sort with another player.

A player who plays his/her next-to-last card must call "Uno" as a warning to the others.

---Gameplay for the QuickPlay Mode
To start a hand, ten cards are dealt to each player, and the top card of the deck is flipped over and set aside to begin the discard pile. The player to the dealer's left plays first, unless the first card on the discard pile is an action or Wild card (see below). On a player's turn, he/she must do one of the following:
play any number of cards as long as they are placed in such an order that they have the same color or number (wild cards can be used in order to change the color and continue play with the new color, all in the same turn. Additionally, if attempting to use multiple action cards, the action cards must be the last cards placed in the discard pile. Finally, draw four and draw 2 cards can be used in conjunction with each other).
play a Wild card, or a playable Wild Draw Four card (see restriction below)
draw the top card of the deck

Play proceeds clockwise around the table.

Action and Wild cards have the following effects:


Card			Effect when played from hand																																					Effect as first discard

Skip			Next player in sequence misses a turn 																																			Player to dealer's left misses a turn 
Draw Two		Next player in sequence draws two cards and misses a turn 																														Player to dealer's left draws two cards and misses a turn 
Reverse			Order of play switches directions (clockwise to counterclockwise, or vice versa) 																								Dealer plays first; play proceeds counterclockwise 
Wild			Player declares next color to be matched (may be used on any turn even if the player has matching color) 																		Player to dealer's left declares starting color, then plays normally 
Wild Draw Four	Player declares next color to be matched; next player in sequence draws four cards and misses a turn. Is legally played only if the player has no cards of the current color 	Return card to deck, shuffle, flip top card to start discard pile 

If a player draws a card that is playable, the player has the option of either keeping it or playing it immediately. Having drawn from the deck, the player will not use any other card from his/her hand on that turn.
A player may play a Wild card at any time, even if that player has other playable cards.
A player may play a Wild Draw Four card only if that player has no cards matching the current color. The player may have cards of a different color matching the current number or symbol or a Wild card and still play the Wild Draw Four card.[3] A player who plays a Wild Draw Four may be challenged by the next player in sequence (see Penalties) to prove that his or her hand meets this condition.
If the entire deck is used during play, the top discard is set aside and the rest of the pile is shuffled to create a new deck. Play then proceeds normally.
It is illegal to trade cards of any sort with another player.

A player who plays his/her next-to-last card must call "Uno" as a warning to the others.

--- PENALTIES (valid in both game modes)
If a player lays down his/her next-to-last card without calling "Uno" and is caught before the next player in sequence takes a turn (i.e., plays a card from their hand or draws from or touches the discard pile), they must draw 2 cards. If the player is not caught in time (subject to interpretation), or remembers to call "Uno" before being caught, he/she suffers no penalty. If you falsely call "Uno" while having multiple cards in your hand, you draw 4 cards.[3]
When a Wild Draw Four card is played, the next player in sequence has the right to challenge the playing of the card if he/she believes that the player has a card in the current color. The player of the Wild Draw Four card privately shows his/her cards to the challenging player. If the challenge is successful, then the player who played the Wild Draw Four must draw four cards; otherwise, the challenging player draws six cards and misses a turn. Regardless of the outcome, the Wild Draw Four remains on the discard pile and the color of further play is the color named by the player who played the card.
If a player lays down a card out of turn, they must draw two cards.

--------------------------------------OBJECTIVE---------------------------------------------------- 
A player wins by having no more cards left in their hand.
